    <img class="headshot" src="/images/5176.jpg" alt="headshot">
    <p>Hey! I am an undergraduate student at San Diego State University studying Electrical Engineering and Physics. I am deeply curious about how things work and how they could work better. My interests include education, computing, and technologies that will enable humans to go beyond our solar system. The purpose of this website is to provide me with a medium through which I can document my journey.</p>

      <h1>Quantum Design Intern</h1>
      <h2>(6/17 - 8/17) [3 mos]</h2>
      <p>During my time at QD, I performed a feasibility study for a proprietary technology which employed the use of Quantum Design's Magnetic Properties Measurement System (MPMS3). <br/>I created 3-D models for prototypes using SolidWorks, ran various measurements on the MPMS3, wrote scripts (in C and BASIC) to perform specialized measurement commands not available in the MPMS3 GUI, and analyzed the data to characterize the prototype's behavior.</p>
